# Prerequisites

We talk about prerequisites:

1. Creating a Nexmo account
2. Buying a number
3. Being able to use Ngrok or Hookbin
4. Installing the command line tools
5. Installing library

We then link to this topic from each building block.

Any prerequisites that are *only* for a specific building block can be
discussed in the building block.
