# Voice API Overview

The Nexmo Voice API is the easiest way to build high-quality voice applications in the Cloud. With the Voice API you can:

* Build apps that scale with the web technologies that you are already using
* Control the flow of inbound and outbound calls in JSON with Nexmo Call Control Objects (NCCO)
* Record and store inbound or outbound calls
* Create conference calls
* Send text-to-speech messages in 23 languages with different genders and accents

## Contents

In this document you can learn about:

* [Nexmo Voice API Concepts](#concepts) to introduce terminology
* [**How to Get Started with the Voice API**](#getting-started) including examples in your language
* [Guides](#guides) learn about working with the Voice API
* [Building Blocks](#building-blocks) code snippets to help with specific tasks
* [Tutorials](#tutorials) detailed tutorials for some common use cases
* [Reference](#reference) API documentation and other supporting content

## Concepts

* **Authentication with JWTs** - interaction with the Voice API are authenticated using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). The [Nexmo libraries](/tools) handle JWT generation using a unique Nexmo Voice Application ID and a Private Key. For more information see [authenticating your applications](/concepts/guides/authentication).

* **Nexmo Voice Applications** - Nexmo Voice Applications represent a one-to-one mapping with the application that you are building. They contain configuration such virtual numbers and webhook callback URLs. You can create Nexmo Voice Applications using the [Nexmo CLI](/tools) or the [Application API](/concepts/guides/applications).

* **[NCCOs](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference)** - Nexmo Call Control Objects are a set of actions that instruct Nexmo how to control the call to your Nexmo application. For example, you can `connect` a call, send synthesized speech using `talk`, `stream` audio, or `record` a call. They are represented in JSON form as an Array of objects. For more information see the [NCCO Reference](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference).

* **[Numbers](/voice/voice-api/guides/numbers)** - The key concepts of using phone numbers in the nexmo voice API.

* **[Webhooks](/concepts/guides/webhooks)** - HTTP requests are made to your application web server so that you can act upon them. For example, an incoming call will send a webhook.

## Getting Started

### Voice Playground

In the [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com), you can try out the Voice API interactively in the Voice Playground. Once you are [signed up for a Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/signup), you can go to [Voice Playground](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/playground) in the Dashboard (Voice â€£ Voice Playground).

More details are available in this blog post: [Meet Voice Playground, Your Testing Sandbox for Nexmo Voice Apps](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/12/12/voice-playground-testing-sandbox-nexmo-voice-apps/)

### Using the API

The primary way that you'll interact with the Nexmo voice platform is via the [public API](/voice/voice-api/api-reference). To place an outbound call, you make a `POST` request to `https://api.nexmo.com/v1/calls`.

To make this easier, we provide client libraries in various languages that take care of authentication and creating the correct request body for you. Choose your language below to get started.

## Guides

* [Call Flow](/voice/voice-api/guides/call-flow): The various stages of a call and how they interact.
* [Legs & Conversations](/voice/voice-api/guides/legs-conversations): When a phone call is made or received by Nexmo it is added to a conversation. A single conversation contains one or more phone calls (sometimes referred to as legs).
* [DTMF](/voice/voice-api/guides/dtmf): Capture user input by detecting DTMF tones (button presses) during a call.
* [Endpoints](/voice/voice-api/guides/endpoints): When connecting a call, you can connect to another phone number, a `sip` endpoint or a `websocket`. These are known as endpoints.
* [Lex connector](/voice/voice-api/guides/lex-connector): You can use the Lex Connector to connect a Nexmo voice call to an [AWS Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) bot and then have an audio conversation with the bot.
* [NCCO](/voice/voice-api/guides/ncco): To tell Nexmo how to handle a phone call, you must provide Nexmo an Nexmo Call Control Objects (NCCO) when a call is placed or answered. There are various actions available, such as `talk`, `input` and `record`.
* [Numbers](/voice/voice-api/guides/numbers): Numbers are a key part of using the Nexmo voice API. This guide covers number formatting, outgoing caller IDs and incoming call numbers.
* [Recording](/voice/voice-api/guides/recording): Recording audio input from a caller or recording the conversation between two callers.
* [Text to Speech](/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech): Using our Text-To-Speech engine, you can play machine-generated speech to your callers
* [Websockets](/voice/voice-api/guides/websockets): You can connect the audio of a call to a websocket to work with it in real time.
