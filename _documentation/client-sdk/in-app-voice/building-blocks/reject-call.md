# Reject a Call

In this building block you will see how to reject a Call, before it was answered.

> The concept of rejecting a call does not exist on Android devices. Instead, it uses the same functionality as hanging up a call. See the [Hangup building block](/client-sdk/in-app-voice/building-blocks/hangup-call) for more information.

## Example

```building_blocks
source: '_examples/client-sdk/in-app-voice/reject-call'
application:
  type: rtc
  name: 'Reject a Call'
```

## Try it out

When you run the code a Call is rejected.
