# Audit API Overview

The Nexmo Audit API allows you to track events. These events are activities created by using the API or by interacting with the Nexmo Dashboard. The Audit API allows you to monitor your Nexmo account.

With this API you can:

* Retrieve a list of Audit events.
* Retrieve a specific Audit event.

It is possible to filter the events retrieved based on parameters such as date, user ID, and event type.

## Developer Preview

This API is currently in Developer Preview.

Nexmo always welcomes your feedback. Your suggestions help us improve the product. If you do need help, please email [support@nexmo.com](mailto:support@nexmo.com) and include Audit API in the subject line. Please note that during the Developer Preview period support times are limited to Monday to Friday.

During Developer Preview Nexmo may expand the capabilities of the Audit API.

## Concepts

### Authentication

Interactions with the Audit API are authenticated using Basic Authentication. Basic Authentication allows you to use your `NEXMO_API_KEY` and `NEXMO_API_SECRET` to validate your API requests. For more information see [authenticating your applications](/concepts/guides/authentication).

### Audit Events

Audit Events are activities that occur when a user interacts with the Nexmo API or the Nexmo Dashboard. Audit events are represented by a JSON object. Examples of audit events include:

* Account settings updates.
* A Nexmo Number gets assigned to an application.
* Creation of a Nexmo application.

Further information on types of audit events is given in the [Audit Event Guide](/audit/guides/audit-events).

### Audit Event object

An example audit event object is 'updating a number' which has `event_type` of `NUMBER_UPDATED`:

``` json
{
  "country":"GB",
  "msisdn":"447700900000",
  "voice-type":"app",
  "voice-value":"aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab"
}
```
