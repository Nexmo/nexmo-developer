# In-App Voice Overview

In-App voice enabled via the Client SDK enables IP based voice communication directly within your web (Javascript), Android, and iOS applications.  With the Client SDK you can easily embed voice into your contact center, marketplace and B2C applications supporting: app to app calling, click-to-call, conferencing, Voice API features such as Automatic Speech Recognition, Websockets, TTS and more. Using the Client SDK also allowes you to easily interconnect In-App voice and In-App messaging.

### Features Include
Client SDK In-App Voice uses WebRTC and includes all the essentials you need to build a feature-rich voice experience

* 1:1 or Group Calls
* Audio Controls â€“ Mute, earmuff
* DTMF Support

### Extendability Through the Voice API
Client SDK In-App Voice is a part of the Vonage Voice API which amplifies the In-App Voice offering through extra functionality

* Calls to phones (PSTN)
* Calls to SIP-enabled devices
* Connection to other services over Websockets
* Call management
* Complex call flow configurations
* Voice stream recording
* Conference calling
* Text-to-speech messages in 23 languages

### Native SDK Specific Features
The Android and iOS Client SDKs offer additional capabilities

* Network Change Handling
* Audio Routing Management
* Push Notifications

## Voice calls

**The way to make a voice call is using the Client SDK `callServer()` method. This allowes for the use of the [Voice API](/voice/voice-api/overview) to manage the call on the server side. The Client SDK application manages the [Event flow](/conversation/guides/event-flow) of the conversation in the client side.**
