# Make a Call

## Overview

This guide covers the functionalities in your Nexmo Client application, in order to start in-app or server-managed voice calls.

Before you begin, make sure you [added the SDK to your app](/client-sdk/setup/add-sdk-to-your-app).


### Start an In-App Call

The quickest way to start an in-app call is by conducting an in-app to in-app call, meaning between two users.

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/make-call/in-app'
frameless: false
```

The possible voice capabilities are very limited, as this doesnâ€™t utilize [Nexmo Voice API](/voice/voice-api/overview). This method is recommended mostly for onboarding. Later, it is recommended to use a server managed call.

### Start a Server Managed Call

This method allows you to conduct in-app calls as well as phone calls while taking advantage of the rich [Nexmo Voice API features](/voice/voice-api/overview).

When your client app calls this method, the `answer_url` [webhook](/concepts/guides/webhooks) that is configured for your [Nexmo Application](/concepts/guides/applications) will execute. That defines the [logic and capabilities](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference) of the call.

On the client side, start the call as such:

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/make-call/server-managed'
frameless: false
```

### Listen For Call Events

To see updates on the state of a call, for example, to know if the other member answered or hung up the call, you should listen to call events.

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/make-call/listen-to-call-events'
frameless: false
```
