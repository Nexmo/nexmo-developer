## Overview

This guide covers the functionalities in your Nexmo Client application, in order to make and receive in-app voice calls.

Before you begin, make sure you [added the SDK to your app](/client-sdk/setup/add-sdk-to-your-app).



### Receive incoming call

In order to receive an incoming in-app call, you should register and listen to incoming call events:

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/start-and-receive-in-app-calls-ios/receive-call'
frameless: false
```


Then, youâ€™ll be able to perform methods such as answer, reject and hang up.

### Answer

```tabbed_content

frameless: false
```

### Reject

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/start-and-receive-in-app-calls-ios/reject'
frameless: false
```


### Hang Up

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/start-and-receive-in-app-calls-ios/hangup'
frameless: false
```

### Listen For Call Events

To see updates on the state of the call member, for example, to know if the other member answered or hung up the call, you should listen to Call events.

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/start-and-receive-in-app-calls-ios/listen-to-call-events'
frameless: false
```
