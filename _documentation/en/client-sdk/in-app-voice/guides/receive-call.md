# Receive a Call


In order to receive an incoming in-app call, you should register and listen to incoming call events:

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/receive-call/receive-call'
frameless: false
```

Then, youâ€™ll be able to perform methods such as answer, reject and hang up.

### Answer

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/receive-call/answer'
frameless: false
```

### Reject

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/receive-call/reject'
frameless: false
```


### Hang Up

For an on-going `call`:

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/receive-call/hangup'
frameless: false
```


### Listen For Call Events

To see updates on the state of a call, for example, to know if the other member answered or hung up the call, you should listen to call events.

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/receive-call/listen-to-call-events'
frameless: false
```
