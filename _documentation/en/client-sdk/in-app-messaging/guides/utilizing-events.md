# Using more Events with the Nexmo Client SDK

In this guide we'll cover adding more conversation events; we'll deal with multiple types of events, the ones that come via the conversation, and the ones we send to the conversation.

## Concepts

This guide will introduce you to the following concepts.

- **Conversation Events** - `member:left` and `text:` events that fire on a Conversation when someone does an Action
- **Conversation Actions** - actions that trigger events on a Conversation
- **Conversation History** - an `events` object that stores all text Events happening on a conversation


> **NOTE:** A step-by-step tutorial to building a web-based chat application is also available [here](/client-sdk/tutorials/in-app-messaging/introduction).
