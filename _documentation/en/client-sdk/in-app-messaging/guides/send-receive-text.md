# Send and Receive Text Messages

## Overview

This guide covers sending and receiving messages within a conversation.

Before you begin, make sure you [added the SDK to your app](/client-sdk/setup/add-sdk-to-your-app) and you are able to [create a simple conversation](/client-sdk/in-app-messaging/guides/simple-conversation).

> **NOTE:** A step-by-step tutorial to building a web-based chat application is also available for [JavaScript](/client-sdk/tutorials/in-app-messaging) and [iOS](/client-sdk/tutorials/ios-in-app-messaging-chat).


This guide will make use of the following concepts:

- **Conversation Events** - `text` events that fire on a Conversation, after you are a Member




## Send a Text Message

Given a conversation you are already a member of:

```tabbed_content
source: _tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/messaging/send-text
```

## Receive a Text Message

A `text` conversation event will be received when a member sends a text message to a conversation:

```tabbed_content
source: _tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/guides/messaging/receive-text
```
