# Inviting Members


## Overview

This guide covers inviting users to a conversation, listening for invites to join a conversation as well as new members joining.

Before you begin, make sure you [added the SDK to your app](/client-sdk/setup/add-sdk-to-your-app) and you are able to [create a simple conversation](/client-sdk/in-app-messaging/guides/simple-conversation).

> **NOTE:** A step-by-step tutorial to building a web-based chat application is also available for [JavaScript](/client-sdk/tutorials/in-app-messaging) and [iOS](/client-sdk/tutorials/ios-in-app-messaging-chat).


This guide will introduce you to the following concepts.

- **Invites** - you can invite users to a conversation
- **Application Events** - `member:invited` events that fire on an Application, before you are a Member of a Conversation
- **Conversation Events** - `member:joined` and `text` events that fire on a Conversation, after you are a Member
