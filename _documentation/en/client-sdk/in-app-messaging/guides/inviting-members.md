# Inviting Members

> **NOTE:** A step-by-step tutorial to building a web-based chat application is also available here for [JavaScript](/client-sdk/tutorials/in-app-messaging) and [iOS](/client-sdk/tutorials/ios-in-app-messaging-chat).

## Concepts

This guide will introduce you to the following concepts.

- **Invites** - you can invite users to a conversation
- **Application Events** - `member:invited` events that fire on an Application, before you are a Member of a Conversation
- **Conversation Events** - `member:joined` and `text` events that fire on a Conversation, after you are a Member
