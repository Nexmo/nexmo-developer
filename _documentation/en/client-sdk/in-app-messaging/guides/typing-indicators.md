# Typing Indicators


## Overview

This guide covers text typing indicators within a conversation.

Before you begin, make sure you [added the SDK to your app](/client-sdk/setup/add-sdk-to-your-app) and you are able to [create a simple conversation](/client-sdk/in-app-messaging/guides/simple-conversation).

```

This guide will make use of the following concepts:

- **Conversation Events** - `text:typing:on` and `text:typing:off` events that fire on a Conversation, after you are a Member


## Typing Indicators

Given a conversation you are already a member of, a `text:typing:on` event will be received when a member starts typing a `text` message. 

Similarly, a `text:typing:off` event will be received when a member stops typing.
