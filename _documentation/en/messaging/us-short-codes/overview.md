# US Short Codes Overview

> **Action Needed For Vonage Customers Using US Shared Short Codes**
>
>**Effective immediately, Vonage will no longer accept new programs for Shared Short Codes for A2P messaging.** T-Mobile and AT&T’s new code of conduct prohibits the use of shared originators, therefore, existing Shared Short Code traffic must be migrated by March 1, 2021. To help you with this transition, please use the Vonage [guide on alternatives](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050905592).  Please [contact us](mailto:support@nexmo.com) to migrate to a new solution.

Vonage provides an API for sending SMS messages from a shared short code to mobile device users in the United States.

Due to [legal and regulatory requirements for use of US Short Codes](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204015403-Preapproved-US-Short-Codes-compliance-requirements), approval is required by Nexmo to use the API. You can apply for a shared US Short Code via the [Vonage Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) in the Numbers section. You will need to ensure that your application follows the best practices outlined at the link above.

Customers using the US Short Codes API use separate endpoints for sending messages to the standard [SMS API](/messaging/sms/overview).
