# 10 DLC Registration API

10 DLC stands for 10 Digit Long Code. Major US carriers have announced their requirements for a new standard for application-to-person (A2P) messaging in the USA, which applies to all messaging over 10 digit geographic phone numbers, also know as 10 DLC. This new standard provides many benefits including supporting higher messaging speeds and better deliverability.

Customers using the Vonage SMS API to send traffic from a **+1 Country Code 10 Digit Long Code into US networks** will need to register a brand and campaign in order to get approval for sending messages.

## Migration to 10 DLC

> **Note:** US numbers can no longer be shared across brands which include both geographic numbers and US Shared Short Codes.

> Vonage customers using US shared short codes:
T-Mobile and AT&Tâ€™s new code of conduct prohibits the use of shared originators, therefore, **Shared Short codes** will no longer be an acceptable format for A2P messaging.
    
* Vonage customers using a Shared Short Code must migrate SMS traffic to either a [10 DLC](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027503992-US-10-DLC-Messaging), [Toll Free SMS Number](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011767768-Toll-free-Numbers-Features-Overview), or  [Dedicated Short Code](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050950831). 
* Vonage customers using our Shared Short Code API ***must migrate*** to either our [SMS API](/messaging/sms/overview) or [Verify API](/verify/overview).
* Customers using Dedicated Short Codes are not affected by these changes within the scope of 10 DLC.

## General Workflow

If you have decided moving to 10 DLC is right for your campaigns, you must:
    
    1. [Register your brand](#register-a-brand)

    2. [Register a campaign] (#register-a-campaign)

    3. Link a number (coming soon)

## Register a brand

A Brand is a company that has a need to send SMS messages to customers or users. Each brand can have multiple Campaigns associated with them. A Vonage Account may have multiple brands associated with it, but a Brand may only be registered with Vonage once. For example, Vonage Account ABCD may register brands on behalf of their own customers, Company X and Company Y. Vonage Account EFGH may not register Company X in that case.

Public information about a brand/company is used to determine what Campaigns they are allowed to run.

Currently only public or private companies and non-profits may be registered. "Personal" accounts cannot be registered, and may be more suitable for a Toll Free Number instead.

## Register a campaign

A Campaign is a notification that a brand will be sending a specific type of message to customers. Campaigns generally have limited use cases associated with them, like Notifications or Two Factor Authentication messages. Each campaign is tied to a single brand, and contains its own pool of numbers. A number cannot be associated with multiple campaigns.

2. Click **Register a new campaign**. 
    The **Create a new campaign** page is displayed.

4. Click **Done**.
5. Under **Step 3 Carrier qualification**, you can determine whether or not your use case has been approved for sending SMS traffic. Qualification is done by 10DLC enabled carriers.

12. Click **Review and pay**.
    A confirmation dialog box opens summarizing your campaign details. Any charges to your account are indicated above the campaign details. You will not be able to change the campaign details after registering.

## Troubleshooting

All error messages that are returned will be returned in the RFC 7807 JSON Format:

```json
{
  "type": "https://developer.nexmo.com/api-errors#unauthorized",
  "title": "Invalid credentials supplied",
  "detail": "You did not provide correct credentials.",
  "instance": "797a8f199c45014ab7b08bfe9cc1c12c"
}
```

Each API Endpoint may have various error messages that can be returned, as well as various HTTP status codes that help indicate the type of failure. In general:

* 2xx responses indicate success
* 400 will indicate a general client-side error, and should contain additional information for resolving the error
* 401 will indicate invalid credentials
* 404 will indicate a missing resource
* 409 will indicate a conflicting operation that may still be pending operations from The Campaign Registry
* 422 will indicate a data validation error, and should contain additional information for correcting the invalid data

Additional information can be found in the OpenAPI specification for individual endpoint errors.
