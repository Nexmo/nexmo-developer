# Handle user input with ASR

A code snippet that shows how to handle a user input with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). 
The user says their input at the prompt and their input is acknowledged
via a speech-to-text message.

## Example

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/voice/handle-user-input-with-asr'
application:
  type: voice
  name: 'User Input ASR Example'
```

## Try it out

Call your Vonage Number. When the call is answered you will be asked
to say a message. When you are finished, you will then hear
your message repeated back to you via speech-to-text.
