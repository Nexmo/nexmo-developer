## 1. Audience

This document is intended for the SIP trunk customerâ€™s technical staff and Value Added Retailer
(VAR) having installation and operational responsibilities. This configuration guide provides steps
for configuring NEC SV9100 version 6.00.50 with Nexmo SIP Trunking services.

## 2. SIP Trunking Network Components

The network for the SIP trunk reference configuration is illustrated below and is representative of
a NEC SV9100 configuration to Nexmo SIP trunking.

### 2.1 Network Components

| Component      | Version                | Comments                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |---------------------------------------------|
| NEC SV9100     | 6.00.50                |                                             |
| Cisco IP Phone | **Model**: `CP-7965` **App Load ID**: `jar45sccp.9-4-2TH1-1.sbn` **Boot Load ID**: `tnp65.9-3-1-CR17.bin`    | This Cisco IP Phone is the PSTN test device |

## 3. Features

#### 3.1.1 Features Supported

* Incoming and outgoing off-net calls using G711ULAW voice codecs
* Calling Line (number) Identification Presentation
* Calling Line (number) Identification Restriction
* Call hold and resume
* Call transfer (semi-attended and consultative)
* 3 way Conference
* Call forward (All, No answer)
* DTMF relay both directions (RFC2833)
* Media flow-through on NEC SV

#### 3.1.2 Features Not Supported by PBX

* None

#### 3.1.3 Features Not Tested

* None

#### 3.1.4 Caveats and Limitations

* When Public DNS is used for resolving sip.nexmo.com, NEC SV9100 receives multiple
target address. NEC sends registration to the first target and when it is challenged, it
sends with authorization details to the second target. Consequently registration fails.
Hence for this testing, a local DNS is used to resolve sip.nexmo.com to one of the
intended target IP addresses and trunk has been registered.
* In the inbound call from Nexmo, the TO header in the INVITE contains `sip.nexmo.com`
instead of the trunk FQDN which is `nexmo.tekvizionlabs.com`.
* In the outbound call from NEC, the From header in the INVITE contains trunk FQDN
(`sip.nexmo.com`) instead of the PBX IP. It appears to be a design intent of NEC SV9100.
* NEC SV9100 does not appear to support Diversion header. Consequently diversion
information is not present in the call forward INVITE from NEC SV9100.
* NEC SV9100 adds +1 to the originating number (From header) in the call forward INVITE
if NEC SV9100 is enabled for E164 dialing.
* In a 3 way conference, when PSTN drops out of the conference, the trunks are not
released until one of the PBX endpoints disconnect
* No Session Audit message is sent from Nexmo
