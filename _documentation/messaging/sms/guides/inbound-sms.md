# Inbound SMS

If you rent one or more virtual numbers from Nexmo, inbound messages to that number are sent to your [webhook endpoint](/concepts/guides/webhooks). If a message sent to your virtual number is longer than maximum number of characters, *concat* is *true* and you receive the message in parts. Use the `concat-ref`, `concat-total` and `concat-part` parameters to reassemble the parts into the message.

Inbound messages are sent using a [GET] or [POST] HTTP request to your [webhook endpoint](/concepts/guides/webhooks). When you receive an inbound message, you must send a `200 OK` response. If you do not send the `200 OK`, otherwise Nexmo will resend the inbound message for the next 24 hours.
