# Nexmo SNS Overview

You use Nexmo SNS to easily subscribe your users to a topic and automatically send them an SMS when you publish a new message.

The workflow for Nexmo SNS is:

1. [Setup SNS access](#setup-sns-access)
2. [Subscribe users to your topic](#subscribe-users-to-your-topic)
3. [Publish a message notification to your users for your topic](#publish-messages-to-your-topic).

## Setup SNS access

SNS access is associated with your Amazon SNS account. To configure SNS:

1. Create your Amazon SNS account from: <http://aws.amazon.com/sns/>.
2. In [SNS dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/home), click *Topics*, then *Create new topic*.
3. In *Create new topic* fill in the form, then click *Create Topic*.
4. In *Actions*, select your topic, then click *edit topic policy*.
5. For *Publishers* and *Subscribers*, add the Nexmo account number (*564623767830*) to *Only these AWS users*, then click *Update Policy*.

The following sections explain how to use the REST API for Nexmo SNS. You can also use [Nexmo Java](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-java) for SNS.

## Subscribe users to your topic

Using the Nexmo SNS API you:
1. Subscribe your users to your topic using a [request](#subscribe-request).
2. Receive a [response](#subscribe-response) and check that the subscription succeeded.

### Subscribe request

A subscribe request to the SNS API looks like:

```
https://sns.nexmo.com/sns/json?api_key=xxxxxxxx&api_secret=xxxxxxxx&to=xxxxxxxxxxxx&cmd=subscribe&topic=arn:aws:sns:<zone>:1:1:<ID>:<channel name>
```

All requests to the SNS API must contain:

* `https://sns.nexmo.com/sns`
* A response object: `json` or `xml`

Your base URL becomes either:

JSON | XML
-- | --
`https://sns.nexmo.com/sns/json` | `https://sns.nexmo.com/sns/xml`

As well as your `api_key` and `api_secret`, the following table shows the parameters you use in the request:

Parameter | Description | Required
-- | -- | --
`cmd` | Set to `subscribe` | Yes
`to` | The phone number of the user you are subscribing to your topic in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164). For example, `to=447700900000`. You can set one recipient only for each request. | Yes
`topic` | Your SNS Topic. For example, `topic=arn:aws:sns:us-east:1:1:000000000000:my_sms_channel` | Yes
