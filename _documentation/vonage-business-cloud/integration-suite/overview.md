# Vonage Integration Suite

Welcome to the Vonage Integration Suite (VIS) Developer API reference.

The Vonage Integration Suite is for software developers who wish to create new applications that integrate with Vonage’s suite of unified communication products. The VIS Developers API is language and platform/OS agnostic and no installation of a software development kit (SDK) is needed. Developers, however, should be familiar with interacting with web services, and in particular, REST and OAuth2.

The Vonage Integration Suite is a premier application that integrates Vonage’s unified communication products with popular external services, such as the Google’s G SuiteTM, and CRMs (for example, SalesforceTM) into a single, consistent application framework. Vonage customers are familiar with the Vonage Integration Suite via a graphical web browser extension that that seamlessly integrates business workflow with communications.

The VIS Developer API is built upon the same powerful backend platform as the Vonage Integration Suite graphical browser extension. In this early access release, the core functionality of the VIS Platform is exposed via APIs so that third-party developers can build their own applications. Examples of applications can include bots for popular collaboration tools or integrating Vonage’s communication products with industry-vertical customer management solutions.
