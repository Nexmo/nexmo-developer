This involves selecting which numbers to use and associating them with your Nexmo Voice API Application.

2. In the left-hand navigation menu, select the Business Apps > Number Programmability menu option.

    > **Note**: If you do not see the Number Programmability menu option, the service is not yet active on your account.

3. Select one of your unconfigured Number Programmability service instances and click the Edit button.

4. On the "Edit Programmability Service" Page:
  1. Enter a name for the service
  2. Select at least one direct dial number that you will call to access the Nexmo Voice API application
