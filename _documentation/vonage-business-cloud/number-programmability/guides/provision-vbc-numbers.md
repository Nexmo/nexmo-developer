# Provision Your VBC Numbers

**Waiting on production version of app I can connect to before I can document this process**

> After you have provisioned a number to use with the Number Programmability service, you are ready to begin developing your Number Programmability service application. See the building blocks in this section to get started. When you are ready to take things further you will find more in-depth information in the [Nexmo Voice API documentation](/voice/voice-api/overview).
