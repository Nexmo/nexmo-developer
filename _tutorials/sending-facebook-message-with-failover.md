# Sending a Facebook message with failover

This tutorial shows you how to use the failover functionality of the Workflows API.

The example Workflow given here will attempt to send a Facebook message using the Messages API, and if this fails it then attempts to send an SMS message to the user using the Messages API.

```

## The steps

After the prerequisites have been met, the steps are as follows:

1. [Configure your webhook URLs](#configure-your-webhook-urls) - This step only required for support of inbound message support and delivery receipts.
2. [Create a Nexmo Application](#create-a-nexmo-application) - The resultant Application ID is used to generate a JWT that you need to make API calls. If you already have an Application ID you can use you don't need to do this step.
3. [Generate a JWT](#generate-a-jwt) - This step is only required if you are not using the client library.
4. [Send a Facebook message with failover](#send-a-message-with-failover) - This step uses the Nexmo Messages API to send a Facebook message with failover.

## Send a message with failover

Sending an message with failover to another channel is achieved by making a single request to the Workflows API endpoint.

In this example you will implement the following workflow:

1. Send a Facebook Messenger message to the user using the Messages API.
2. If the failover condition is met proceed to the next step. In this example the failover condition is the message not being read.
3. Send an SMS to the user using the Messages API.

Key | Description
-- | --
`FROM_NUMBER` | The phone number you are sending the message from. **Don't use a leading `+` or `00` when entering a phone number, start with the country code, for example, 447700900000.**
`FB_SENDER_ID` | Your Page ID. The `FB_SENDER_ID` is the same as the `to.id` value you received in the inbound messenger event on your Inbound Message Webhook URL.
`FB_RECIPIENT_ID` | The PSID of the user you want to reply to. The `FB_RECIPIENT_ID` is the PSID of the Facebook User you are messaging. This value is the `from.id` value you received in the inbound messenger event on your Inbound Message Webhook URL.
