## The steps

After the prerequisites have been met, the steps are as follows:

1. [Configure your webhook URLs](#configure-your-webhook-urls) - This step only required for support of inbound message support and delivery receipts.
2. [Create a Nexmo Application](#create-a-nexmo-application) - The resultant Application ID is used to generate a JWT that you need to make API calls. If you already have an Application ID you can use you don't need to do this step.
3. [Generate a JWT](#generate-a-jwt) - This step is only required if you are not using the client library.
4. [Send a Viber Service message](#send-a-viber-service-message) - This step uses the Nexmo Messages API to send a Viber Service message.
