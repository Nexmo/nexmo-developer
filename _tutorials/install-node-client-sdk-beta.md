# Install the Node Client SDK

If you are planning to use JavaScript to develop your application, you'll need to install (or update) the Beta version of the Nexmo Client SDK.

Create a new project directory and change into it. Then run the following command:

``` bash
$ npm install nexmo-client@beta
```

This will install the Client SDK into the `node_modules` directory within your project folder.

If you already have the Client SDK installed the above command will upgrade your Client SDK to the latest version.
