If you are planning to use JavaScript to develop your application, you'll need to install (or update) the Beta version of the Nexmo Client SDK.

### Installation

During Beta, the Node Client SDK can be installed using:

``` bash
$ npm install --save nexmo-client@beta
```

If you already have the Client SDK installed the above command will upgrade your Client SDK to the latest version.

In your `node_modules` directory you can use the command `npm list | grep nexmo` to check the version you have installed.
