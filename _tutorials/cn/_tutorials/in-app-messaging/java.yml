Then, you will authenticate these Users and add them to the Conversation as Members.\n\nFinally, you will implement chat functionality in your application, including the ability to view and send messages and be notified when a new message appears in Conversation.\n\nThe source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-android-tutorial-messaging).\n\n### This tutorial requires the following versions:\n\n- Android (6.0 and above - API level 23 and above)\n- Client SDK for Android 2.6.4\n\nLast update: September 2020\n"
