Run your application
====================

1. Open `index1.html` into a browser tab. This is the **make call** tab.
2. Start a new Incognito tab (if using Google Chrome), or a new browser instance.
3. Open `index2.html` into this new tab or instance. This is the **receive call** tab.

In the **make call** tab:

1. Enter `Bob` into the text box as the user to call.
2. Click the `Call` button to make the call.

In the **receive call** tab:

1. Note the status has changed to reflect the incoming call.
2. Click Answer to answer the call.

You can now test the two-way voice call, although you may experience some audio feedback.

> **NOTE:** You may be prompted to allow your web browser access to your microphone and speaker. It is necessary to allow this for testing purposes.
