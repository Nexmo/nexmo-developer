If you do not already have Ngrok, learn how to get it [ running locally](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/webhooks#using-ngrok-for-local-development).

With the application's webhook URLs pointing to Ngrok, Ngrok will redirect the webhooks to your local machine through a secure tunnel for testing purposes.

Make sure you have Ngrok running for testing locally. To start Ngrok type:

``` shell
./ngrok http 3000
```

To generate a temporary Ngrok URL. 

If you are a paid subscriber you could type:

``` shell
./ngrok http 3000 -subdomain=your_domain
```

> **NOTE:** In this example Ngrok will divert the Nexmo webhooks you specified when you created your Nexmo application to `localhost:3000`. Although port 3000 is shown here, you can use any free port that is convenient.
