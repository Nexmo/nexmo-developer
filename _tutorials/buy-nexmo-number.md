# Buy a Nexmo number 

## Using the Nexmo Dashboard

First you can [browse your existing numbers](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/your-numbers).

If you have no spare numbers you can [buy one](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers).

## Using the Nexmo CLI

First search for a suitable number:

```
nexmo number:search GB
```

You can change the country code to suit your requirements. For example if you are in the US you could use:

```
nexmo number:search US
```

Choose a suitable number and then buy it using a command similar to:

```
nexmo number:buy 442039051952
