# Sending Facebook Messenger messages with Messages API

Before continuing with this tutorial you should review the information on [Understanding Facebook messaging](/messages-and-workflows-apis/messages/concepts/facebook).

## The steps

After the prerequisites have been met, the steps are as follows:

1. [Create a Facebook Page](#create-a-facebook-page) - You require a Facebook Account and a Facebook Page.
2. [Configure your webhook URLs](#configure-your-webhook-urls) - This step only required for support of inbound message support and delivery receipts.
3. [Create a Nexmo Application](#create-a-nexmo-application) - The resultant Application ID is used to generate a JWT that you need to make API calls. If you already have an Application ID you can use you don't need to do this step.
4. [Generate a JWT](#generate-a-jwt) - This step is only required if you are not using the client library.
5. [Link your Facebook Page to Nexmo](#link-your-facebook-page-to-nexmo)
6. [Receive a Facebook message](#Receive a Facebook message) - Receive a Facebook message from a Facebook User.
7. [Reply to a Facebook message](#reply-to-a-facebook-message) - Reply to the Facebook User.

## Create a Facebook Page

To use the Messages API with Facebook Messenger you must have a Facebook Account and a Facebook Page.

```

```

## Link your Facebook Page to Nexmo

Next you'll need to link your Facebook Page to Nexmo. This will allow Nexmo to handle the inbound messages and allow you to send messages from the Nexmo Messages API. This process needs to be authenticated by JWT. You will need to paste in the JWT you created in the previous step when prompted.

Click the following link when you have your JWT pasted to the clipboard and you are ready to link your Facebook Page to Nexmo:

## Receive a Facebook message

When a Facebook message is sent by a Facebook User to your Facebook Page an event will be sent to your Inbound Message Webhook URL. An example event is shown here:

```json
{
  "message_uuid":"aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "to":{
    "type":"messenger",
    "id":"0000000000000000"
  },
  "from":{
    "type":"messenger",
    "id":"1111111111111111"
  },
  "timestamp":"2020-01-01T14:00:00.000Z",
  "message":{
    "content":{
      "type":"text",
      "text":"Hello from Facebook Messenger!"
    }
  }
}
```

You will need to extract the `from.id` value here as this is the ID that you will need to send a reply.

## Reply to a Facebook message

You can then use the Messages API to respond to the inbound message received from the Facebook User.

Replace the following variables in the example below with actual values:

Key | Description
-- | --
`FB_SENDER_ID` | Your Page ID. The `FB_SENDER_ID` is the same as the `to.id` value you received in the inbound messenger event on your Inbound Message Webhook URL.
`FB_RECIPIENT_ID` | The PSID of the user you want to reply to. The `FB_RECIPIENT_ID` is the PSID of the Facebook User you are messaging. This value is the `from.id` value you received in the inbound messenger event on your Inbound Message Webhook URL.
