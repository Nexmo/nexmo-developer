If you want to carry out tasks such as creating applications, purchasing Vonage numbers and so on, you will need to install the Nexmo CLI. As the Nexmo CLI requires `node.js` you will need to [install `node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) first.

To make sure `node.js` is installed, please run the following command in the terminal:
```js
node -v
```
