# Add Environment Variables

Create a new file in the root folder of the project called `.env`. This file will contain environment variables for the Vonage API credentials we will need to use the Vonage Voice API.

Inside the `.env` file add the following environment variables, making sure to add your credentials from your Vonage API Dashboard account:

```ruby
VONAGE_API_KEY=
VONAGE_API_SECRET=
VONAGE_APPLICATION_ID=
VONAGE_APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=
TO_NUMBER=
VONAGE_NUMBER=
```
