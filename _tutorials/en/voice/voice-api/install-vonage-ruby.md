# Install Vonage Ruby

To install the Vonage Ruby gem, add the following to your project's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'vonage'
```

If this is a new `Gemfile` make sure that the following is at the top of the file prior to adding the Vonage gem:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
```

Then, run `bundle install` from the terminal.
