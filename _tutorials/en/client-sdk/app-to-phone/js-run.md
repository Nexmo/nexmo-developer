# Run your application

Open `index.html` in a browser.

A button is displayed on the page.

Click the `Call Your Phone` button.

You can also open up the web browser console and view logging messages there for your web app and the Client SDK. You will see the application attempting to connect to your phone.

Once the call comes through, you can answer it and hear the in-app voice call.
