# Run your application

Open `index.html` in a browser.

A text field and button is displayed on the page.

Enter the number of your mobile phone into the text field in [E.164](/concepts/guides/glossary#e-164-format) format (for example, `447700900000`) and then click the `Call` button.

You can also open up the web browser console and view logging messages there for your web app and the Client SDK. You will see the application attempting to connect to the target number you provided.

Once the call comes through you can answer it and hear the in-app voice call.
