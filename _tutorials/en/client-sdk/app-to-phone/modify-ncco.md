# Modify NCCO

A Nexmo Call Control Object (NCCO) is a JSON array that you use to control the flow of a Voice API call. More information on NCCO can be found [here](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference).

The NCCO must be public and accessible by the internet. To accomplish that, we will be using [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

To create your NCCO

1) Go to [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/).
   
2) Copy and paste the following JSON object into the gist:
    ```json
    [{
      "action": "talk",
      "text": "Please wait while we connect you"
     },
     {
      "action": "connect",
      "endpoint": [{
          "type": "phone",
          "number": "Your-Phone-Number"
      }]
    }]
    ```
3) Replace Your-Phone-Number with your phone number (must be in [E.164](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/glossary#e-164-format) format i.e. 14155550100)

4) Click the ```Create secret gist``` button.

5) Click the ```Raw``` button. Take note of the URL, you will be using it in the next step.
