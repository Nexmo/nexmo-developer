# Send a message

Time to send the first message.

Inside `ChatViewModel` class, locate the `onSendMessage` method and fill its body:

```kotlin
fun onSendMessage(message: String) {
    if (conversation == null) {
        _errorMessage.postValue("Error: Conversation does not exist")
        return
    }

    conversation?.sendText(message, object : NexmoRequestListener<Void> {
        override fun onSuccess(p0: Void?) {
        }

        override fun onError(apiError: NexmoApiError) {
        }
    })
}
```

> **NOTE:** Inside `ChatFragment` class, contains `sendMessageButton listener` that was written for you. This method is called when user click `send` button. If message text exists above `viewModel.onSendMessage()` method is called.

You'll notice that, although the message was sent, the conversation doesn't include it. It is possible to call the `getConversationEvents()` method after the message is sent, but the SDK provides a better way to handle this scenario.
