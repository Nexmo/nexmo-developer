# Add the Vonage .NET SDK

Move into the `VonageSms` directory that you created in the previous step and execute the following command:

```sh
dotnet add package Vonage
```

You can now open the `VonageSms.csproj` file in Visual Studio.

> **Note**: This tutorial assumes that you are using Visual Studio. Alternatively, you could open the `VonageSms` folder in Visual Studio Code or another editor, but you might have to create some of the scaffolding that Visual Studio generates for you.
