# What's next?

In this tutorial you learned how to authenticate a user using their mobile number. To achieve this you used the Verify API to send the user a code, collected this code from them and sent it back to the Verify API to check.

You probably wouldn't want to use this approach in place of passwords, because SMS isn't a secure enough medium for that, but it can provide some reassurance that a user is who they claim to be and is therefore a reasonable strategy for step-up authentication.

Find out more about the Verify API using the following resources:
