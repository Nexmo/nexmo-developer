## Setting Up for IVR

In order to work through this tutorial you need:

* A [Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up).
* The [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/nexmo/nexmo-cli) installed and set up.
* A serverless node.js function so that the Vonage API platform can notify your application about incoming calls and call events, or for local development we recommend [vercel](https://vercel.com). 
* The [tutorial code](https://github.com/spiritbro1/nodejs-phone-menu), either clone the repository or download and extract the zip file to your machine.
