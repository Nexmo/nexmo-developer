# Run your application

Run your web server locally in your project directory with (for example) `http-server`.

Your application `index.html` is automatically loaded and a simple text field and button displayed. 

Enter the number of your mobile phone into the text field in E.164 format (for example, `447700900000`) and then click the call button.

To see the webhook server logging switch to the terminal tab running your server. You can also open up the web browser console and view logging messages there.

You will see the application attempting to connect to the target number your provided.

Once the call comes through you can answer it and hear the in-app voice call.
