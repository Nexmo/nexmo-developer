# Run your application

> **NOTE:** If you have not already done so, make sure you have [Ngrok running](/client-sdk/tutorials/app-to-phone/prerequisites#how-to-run-ngrok).

Run your web server locally in your project directory with `http-server`, or other command depending on which HTTP server you installed.

Your application `index.html` is automatically loaded when the web server starts.
