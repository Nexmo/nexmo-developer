# Create your app to phone code

Create an HTML file called `index.html` in your project directory. Add the following code, but make sure you paste in the JWT you generated for the user in the [earlier step](/client-sdk/tutorials/app-to-phone/client-sdk/generate-jwt) in this tutorial:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <script src="./node_modules/nexmo-client/dist/nexmoClient.js"></script>
</head>

<body>

  <form id="call-phone-form">
    <h1>Call Phone from App</h1>
    <input type="text" name="phonenumber" value="">
    <input type="submit" value="Call" />
  </form>

  <script>

    const USER_JWT = 'PASTE YOUR USER JWT HERE';

    class PhoneApp {

      constructor() {
        this.callPhoneForm = document.getElementById('call-phone-form');
        this.setupUserEvents();
        this.createClient();
      }

    createClient() {
        console.log("DEBUG: creating client with JWT:  ", USER_JWT);
        new NexmoClient({ debug: false })
          .login(USER_JWT)
          .then(app => {
            console.log('DEBUG: Logged into app', app);
            this.app = app;

            app.on("member:call", (member, call) => {
              this.call = call;
              console.log("DEBUG: member:call - ", call);
            })

            app.on("call:status:changed", (call) => {
              console.log("DEBUG: call:status:changed - ", call.status);
            })
          })
          .catch(this.errorLogger)
      }

      setupUserEvents() {
        this.callPhoneForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          this.app.callServer(this.callPhoneForm.children.phonenumber.value);
        })
      }

      errorLogger(error) {
        console.log("ERROR: ", error);
      }

    }
    new PhoneApp();
  </script>
</body>

</html>
```

This is your web application that will use the Client SDK to make a voice call to the destination phone via Nexmo.

There are several key components to this code:

1. A simple UI that allows you to enter a phone number and then click the `Call` button to make the voice call.
2. Code that logs the user in (a JWT is used for authentication).
3. Event handlers for `member:call` and `call:status:changed`.
4. The function to make the call `callServer(number)`, where number is the destination phone number in E.164 format.

Once you enter the phone number and click call you will hear a voice reporting on call status. Then when the call goes through you can answer and you will then hear the conversation via the app.

In a later step you will see how to run this app via a local web server.
