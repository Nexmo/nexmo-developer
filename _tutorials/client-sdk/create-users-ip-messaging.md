# Create a User

[Users](/conversation/concepts/user) are a key concept when working with the Nexmo Client SDKs. When a user authenticates with the Client SDK, the credentials provided identify them as a specific user. Each user will typically correspond to a single record in your users database.

Execute the following commands to create two users, `USER1_NAME` and `USER2_NAME` who will log in to the Nexmo Client and participate in the chat.

```bash
nexmo user:create name="USER1_NAME"
nexmo user:create name="USER2_NAME"
```

This will return user IDs similar to the following:

```sh
User created: USR-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab
```

Make a note of these as you'll need them later.
