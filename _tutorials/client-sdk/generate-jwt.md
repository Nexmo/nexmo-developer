# Generate a JWT

You need to generate a JWT for the user. The JWT is used to authenticate the user.

In the following code remember to replace the `MY_APP_ID` and `MY_USER_NAME` variables with your own values:

``` shell
nexmo jwt:generate ./private.key sub=MY_USER_NAME exp=$(($(date +%s)+86400)) acl='{"paths":{"/*/users/**":{},"/*/conversations/**":{},"/*/sessions/**":{},"/*/devices/**":{},"/*/image/**":{},"/*/media/**":{},"/*/applications/**":{},"/*/push/**":{},"/*/knocking/**":{}}}' application_id=MY_APP_ID
```

The above command sets the expiry of the JWT to one day from now, which is the maximum.

> **NOTE**: In production apps, it is expected that your backend will expose an endpoint that generates a JWT for each client request.
