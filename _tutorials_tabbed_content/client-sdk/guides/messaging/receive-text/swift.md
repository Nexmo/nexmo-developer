Add `NXMConversationDelegate` as an extension to a `ViewController` or similar, and implement `conversation(_ conversation: NXMConversation, didReceive event: NXMTextEvent)`:

> Note: The first method below is required when implementing `NXMConversationDelegate`:

```swift
extension ViewController: NXMConversationDelegate {
    func conversation(_ conversation: NXMConversation, didReceive error: Error) {
        NSLog("Conversation error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
    func conversation(_ conversation: NXMConversation, didReceive event: NXMTextEvent) {
        NSLog("Received text event: \(event.text ?? "")")
    }
}
```
