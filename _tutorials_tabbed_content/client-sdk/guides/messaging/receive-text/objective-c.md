Have a `ViewController`, or similar, conform to `NXMConversationDelegate` and implement `conversation:didReceiveTextEvent:`:

> Note: The first method below is required when implementing `NXMConversationDelegate`:

```objective_c
- (void)conversation:(NXMConversation *)conversation didReceive:(NSError *)error {
    NSLog(@"Conversation error: %@", error.localizedDescription);
}
- (void)conversation:(NXMConversation *)conversation didReceiveTextEvent:(NXMTextEvent *)event {
    NSLog(@"Received text event: %@", event.text);
}
```
