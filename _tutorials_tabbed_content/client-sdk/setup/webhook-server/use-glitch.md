To get started faster, we have a [Glitch](https://glitch.com) webhook server that you can remix and use so you do not need to set one up locally.

Steps:
- Remix the webhook server template: [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/ash-traveling-globe](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/ash-traveling-globe)
- Take note of your Glitch Project Name: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/glitch-project-name
