## Part 1: Connect your Facebook Page to your Vonage API account

Connecting your Facebook page to your Vonage API account allows Vonage to handle inbound messages and enables you to send messages from the Messages API.

1. To link your Facebook page to your Vonage API account visit the [Link Facebook Page in your dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/messages/social-channels/facebook-connect).

2. Log into your Facebook account from the dashboard.

3. Select the Facebook Page you want to connect to your Vonage API account from the drop down list.

4. Select the API key you'd like to use.

5. Click **Complete setup**.

At this point your Vonage API Account and this Facebook Page are linked. The link between your Vonage API account and Facebook page expires after 90 days. After then you must re-link it using the same process.

## Part 2: Connect your Facebook Page to your Vonage API application

Once your Facebook page is connected to your Vonage API account, it becomes available for use by any of your applications. To connect the Facebook page to a Vonage API application:

1. Navigate to your [applications page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/applications).

2. From the list, click on the application you want to link. You can filter by using the **Capabilities** drop down and selecting `messages` to make this easier.

3. Then, select the **Linked social channels** tab.

4. Click the **Link** button beside the Facebook Page to which you want to connect your application, ensuring that the **Provider** is **Facebook Messenger**.

You're now ready to receive messages users send to you on your Facebook Page.

> **NOTE:** If in the future you want to link a different application to this Facebook page, you only need to repeat the procedure described in Part 2, for the new application.
