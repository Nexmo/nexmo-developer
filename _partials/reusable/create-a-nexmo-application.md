## Create a Nexmo Application

In order to create a JWT to authenticate your API requests, you will need to first create a Nexmo Application.

### Create a Nexmo Messages and Dispatch Application using the Dashboard

This can be done under the [Messages and Dispatch tab in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/messages/create-application).

When you are creating the Nexmo Application in the [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/messages/create-application) you can click the link _Generate public/private key pair_ - this will create a public/private key pair and the private key will be downloaded by your browser.

> **TIP:** Make a note of the Nexmo Application ID for the created application, as you will need this to generate your JWT.
