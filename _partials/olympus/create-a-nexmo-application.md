## Create a Nexmo Application

In order to create a JWT to authenticate your API requests, you will need to first create a Nexmo Application.

There are two ways to create a Nexmo Application:

* Using the Dashboard
* Using the Nexmo Command Line Interface

### Create a Nexmo Application using the Dashboard

This can be done under the [Voice tab in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/create-application).

> **NOTE:** When creating a Nexmo Voice Application, you will be asked to provide an Event URL and an Answer URL. These are currently only used by the Voice API and are ignored by the Messages and Workflows APIs, so in this case you can just set them to the suggested values of `https://example.com/webhooks/event` and `https://example.com/webhooks/answer` respectively.

When you are creating the Nexmo Voice Application in the [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) you can click the link _Generate public/private key pair_ - this will create a public/private key pair and the private key will be downloaded by your browser.

### Create a Nexmo Application using the Nexmo CLI

Alternatively, you can create a Nexmo Application using the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli) tool if you have [installed it](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli).

Using the Nexmo CLI create your application as follows:

``` bash
$ nexmo app:create "My App" https://example.com/webhooks/answer https://example.com/webhooks/event --keyfile=private.key
```

> **TIP:** Make a note of the Nexmo Application ID for the created application, as you will need this to generate your JWT.
