A Vonage API [number](/numbers/guides/number-management) is a phone number that you can link to your Vonage API Application. When a user calls that phone number, the `answer_url` that is defined on your Vonage API Application is executed. In this tutorial case, you set up an `answer_url` in the above step, that upon calling connects the call to your app user `Jane`.

To link a Vonage API number to your app:

1. Go to your [Vonage API dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com)
2. Navigate to [applications](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/your-applications)
3. Select your application
4. Click the 'Edit' button.

5. Switch to `Numbers` tab above, search for a number you'd like, and click `Link`, to link.
