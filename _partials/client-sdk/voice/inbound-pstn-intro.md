In this guide, we'll learn how to forward an incoming phone call to a Nexmo phone number, to an in-app user by implementing a webhook and linking that to a Nexmo application.

You will create a simple app to receive a call. The app will automatically log in a user called Jane. After logging in, Jane is able to receive a call and perform actions such as answer, decline or hangup.
