## Improved API References, Content and SSML

Since [v1.1.0](#launching-nexmo-developer) we've made many changes across the board to improve our content.

Today we're happy to release a full revision of our SMS content including a new cleaner [API Reference](/api/sms) page powered by Open API Definitions. We've also made it easier to [get started](/messaging/sms/overview#icon-node-try-it) with Nexmo and have built tooling to make complicated subjects such as SMS [Concatenation and Encoding](/messaging/sms/guides/concatenation-and-encoding) easier to understand.

Furthermore here are just a handful of other changes we've made recently:

- Added [SSML](/voice/voice-api/guides/ssml) documentation
- Added a [Team](/team) page
- Improved [Contribution](/contribute/overview) section
- Lots of improvements to building blocks
- Added a new footer with helpful links and API status
- Improvements to search
- Many hundreds of improvements and fixes to our content and tools
