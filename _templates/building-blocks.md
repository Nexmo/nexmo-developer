# ...Building block name...

<!--

What is a building block?

Building Blocks are used as a quick reference of how to do something specific.
They are aimed at users who are somewhat familiar with the product and require
a 'snippet' of code or supplementary information to support them during development
phase. The mindset of the reader is "I want to get stuff done right now". They
should only contain *one* piece of functionality.

HOWTO: write a building block.

* Lay out each of the steps as subheadings.

* Use a table for key/value mappings (for request headings, JSON dicts, etc.)

* Prefer the use of the Nexmo client libraries over implementing your own.

* Extraneous detail that is not of general applicability should not be placed
  in a building block article but stored in a guide, and potentially fleshed
  out in a tutorial.
