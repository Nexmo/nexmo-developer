    # Introduction
    The [Vonage SMS API](/messaging/sms/overview) is an HTTP-based API using either XML or JSON to describe how to send an SMS or understand a received SMS. Vonage provides a Python client library called nexmo-python that takes care of a lot of the underlying detail for you.

    > Before starting, make sure you have Python installed. The code here was tested on Python 2.7 and 3.6. If youâ€™re running Python 2, make sure you also have [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed.
