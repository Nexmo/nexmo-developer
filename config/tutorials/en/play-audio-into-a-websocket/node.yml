    # Introduction

    You can use the Vonage Voice API to connect a call to a [WebSocket](/voice/voice-api/guides/websockets), giving you a two-way stream of the call audio delivered over the WebSocket protocol in real-time. This enables you to process the call audio to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, real-time transcription and decision-making using artificial intelligence.

    In this tutorial, you will connect an inbound call to a WebSocket endpoint. The WebSocket server will stream an audio file into the call. You will implement this using the [express](https://expressjs.com) web application framework and [express-ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-ws), which lets you define WebSocket endpoints like any other `express` route.
