    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Client SDK application and then write the code to make a 
    phone call from your web app to another web app.

    To achieve this, you will create:

    * A web application that will make the app to app voice call using the Client SDK.
    * A publicly accessible URL that serves instructions, an <abbr title="Nexmo Call Control Object">NCCO</abbr>, on how to handle the call. You will use a GitHub Gist to accomplish this. <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Gists</a> are a simple way to share code snippets with others.

    When the in-app call is triggered from your application, Nexmo will use the NCCO from GitHub Gist and forward the call to the destination app.
