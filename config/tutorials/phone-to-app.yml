    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Client SDK application and then write the code to receive an
    inbound PSTN call.

    To achieve this, you will need:

    * A web application that will notify the service agent of an inbound call and offer the facility to answer it
    * A webhook server that can process an inbound webhook and return an NCCO to forward the inbound call to your application

prerequisites:
- create-nexmo-account
- install-nodejs
- install-express
- install-nexmo-cli-beta
- install-node-client-sdk
