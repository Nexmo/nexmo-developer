    content: "# Introduction\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Client SDK application and then write the code to make a \nphone call from your web app to another web app.\n\nTo achieve this, you will create:\n\n* A web application that will make the app to app voice call using the Client SDK.\n* A publicly accessible URL that serves instructions, an <abbr title=\"Nexmo Call Control Object\">NCCO</abbr>, on how to handle the call. You will use a GitHub Gist to accomplish this. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Gists</a> are a simple way to share code snippets with others.\n\nWhen the in-app call is triggered from your application, Nexmo will use the NCCO from GitHub Gist and forward the call to the destination app.\n"
